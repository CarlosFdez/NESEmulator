# NESEmulator
A simple emulator created as an exercise in order to understand low level computing. It is meant to be executed with Python 3.3.0, although any recent python should work.

## Tests
This emulator's tests are made using python's unittest library. To run them, use the unittest module with test discovery, or run the following in a terminal (discover is optional):

`python -m unittest discover`
